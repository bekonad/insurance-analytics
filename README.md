## Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling

This repository contains the code and documentation for the 10 Academy Artificial Intelligence Mastery project, focusing on end-to-end insurance risk analytics for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS).

### Project Overview
- **Objective**: Analyze historical car insurance claim data to identify low-risk segments and optimize premium pricing.
- **Duration**: 11 June - 17 June 2025
- **Data**: Historical insurance data from Feb 2014 to Aug 2015.
- **Tasks**:
  - Task 1: Git/GitHub setup and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  - Task 2: Data Version Control (DVC) setup.
  - Task 3: A/B Testing (in progress).
  - Task 4: Statistical Modeling 

### Progress
- **Task 1**: Completed. EDA conducted in `EDA_Insurance_Analytics.ipynb`, analyzing loss ratios (e.g., Gauteng 0.429, Heavy Commercial 0.794) and distributions.
- **Task 2**: Completed. DVC configured with `insurance_data.txt.dvc`.
- **Documentation**: Interim report and EDA notebook PDFs available in `/docs`.

### How to Use
